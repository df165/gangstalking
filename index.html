    <h1>So you're being gangstalked?</h1>
    <p>Good luck!</p>
    <div class="bold main">
        <p class="bold left">1. Why is this happening to me?</p>
        <p class="left">Who knows, I've spoken to countless people who have claimed they're being gang stalked everyone has their own reasons, 
            realistically you just got unlucky or lucky depending on how you view it. They don't **need** a reason, maybe you pissed off the wrong person, or did a crime and were never *caught*,
            you could be a whistleblower, maybe you did nothing and you're just an innocent victim, either way the fact that there's nothing concrete you can point to as to why it's happening is part of the program
            for the majority of people.</p>
        <p class="bold left">2. Should I try medication?</p>
        <p class="left">I'd reccomend everyone tries medication for psychosis at first, 
            there are some distinct differences between psychosis and gangstalking that is basically a "you know it when you see it" type thing, see if it works or not for you.</p>
        <p class="bold left">3. Who is it?</p>
        <p class="left">Again in the T.I. (Targeted Individual) realm there is a range of suspects. Everything from spooks (CIA, MI6 etc.) to Angels and Demons, 
            Freemasons and the Vatican. Me personally, I'm pretty sure it must be an intelligence agency trying out its fancy new toys.</p>
        <p class="bold left">4. What can I do?</p>
        <p class="left">That's a hard question, I think the main thing a T.I. can do is try and have a good support system, 
            it's truly an evil experience to go through and not everyone is cut out to survive it being brutally honest. 
            I'm lucky in that I'm substantially smarter than my gangstalkers, so much so they've basically stopped talking back to me since they know I'd annhilate them in the marketplace of ideas and 
            they're stinky fascists on top of that.</p>
        <p class="bold left">5. What should I do?</p>
        <p class="left">Everyones targetting is different, some people just experience on the ground group stalking, others get V2K (Voice to skull) and others get DEWs (Direct Enegry Weapons) and 
            RNM (Remote Neural Monitoring) on top of that. Try and get some proof, recording people making weird signs at you or whatever your program entails might help you convince family and friends.</p>
        <p class="bold left">6. Can they read my mind?</p>
        <p class="left">Yes.</p>
        <p class="bold left">7. Can they see through my eyes?</p>
        <p class="left">Yes.</p>
        <p class="bold left">8. Can they see and interact with my dreams?</p>
        <p class="left">Yes.</p>
        <p class="bold left">9. If I go off the grid will they still be able to target me?</p>
        <p class="left">For some people this works, but I think it's a red herring. I believe it's sattelites that'd be able to reach you anywhere on earth and can even penetrate the earth (such as being able to reach you while on the london undereground) You could try it out but results will vary!</p>
